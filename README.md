# DSI Instructor Task: Part 2

---

## Background
During your role in our data science immersive, you'll need to be able to quickly scan and debug student code, while providing helpful feedback or tips. Therefore, this challenge is intended to help you demonstrate your instructional skills!

## Instructions
In your notebook, move onto "Part 2" and log your responses accordingly. Please provide feedback for both of the sample student submissions provided below. Use the following guidelines to help structure your responses:

1. **Code**
    - Feel free to comment on style, library usage, or other improvements.
2. **Methodology**
    - Feel free to comment on the student's data setup, modeling methodology, and model evaluation.
3. **Conceptual Understanding**
    - Finally, feel free to add any suggestions or takeaways on how the student could continue to improve their understanding of these concepts.

> Note: Assume the student is a relative beginner with novice programming skills. Their background may include college courses in data or statistics, but don't assume that they are comfortable with these concepts.

## Sample Student Submissions

- [Student Samples: Please review the following *two* python code snippets taken from student submissions.](https://gist.github.com/jeff-boykin/3af5e25eabd6c10d8aa248c556f625a0)

> Note: For your reference, student samples refer to the [following dataset](https://gist.github.com/jeff-boykin/9e1a450ef152604e6830ce70f4fc1be8).
